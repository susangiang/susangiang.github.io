          <h2>Context</h2>
          <p>
            I'm currently working with a major Canadian retailer to transform their e-commerce platform into a cohesive digital experience that will scale to all five of their subsidiaries, starting with the parent company. Over the course of 3 months, I focused on the Cart experience, a critical point of the customer journey that sets customers up for success before they begin the checkout process.
          </p>
          <p>
            The work delivered in this phase of work would act as the foundational pieces for future phases, where other 5 subsidiaries are expected to undergo digital transformations. With this in mind, scalability and reusability is kept top of mind; ensuring that the solutions and components that are designed are modular and versatile is critical to creating a consistent and cohesive family of brands.

        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Role</h2>
          <p>
            The project team as a whole is around ~50 members, consisting of folks from Design, Functional, Development, Data, Strategy, Business, etc. I work closely with the Functional, Data, and Development team on a regular basis to gather requirements and data insights, and identify technical constraints and scope definition.
          </p>
          <p>
            The design team consists of 4 interaction designers, 4 visual designers, 2 design leads and a design director. The team is divided into 4 pods, with each pod (consisting of an interaction design and visual designer) being responsible for various parts of the platform. I'm a visual designer and my squad has been tasked with redefining the Cart and Checkout experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            I work alongside my partner, the interaction designer, to translate business and user requirements into delightful experiences that further elevate customers' online shopping experiences.

            While all of the artifacts I've worked on are under an NDA, I would be happy to share my design process and discuss the project in further detail through an email or call.
