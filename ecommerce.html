          <h4 class="project__subhead">Context</h4>
          <div class="project-body">
            <p>I'm currently working with a major Canadian retailer to transform their e-commerce platform into a cohesive digital experience
              that will scale to all five of their subsidiaries, starting with the parent company. Over the course of 3 months, I focused on
              the Cart experience, a critical point of the customer journey that sets customers up for success before they begin the checkout
              process.
            </p>

            <p>The work delivered in this phase of work would act as the foundational pieces for future phases, where other 5 subsidiaries are
              expected to undergo digital transformations. With this in mind, scalability and reusability is kept top of
              mind; ensuring that the solutions and components that are designed are modular and versatile is critical to creating a consistent
              and cohesive family of brands.
            </p>

            <h4 class="project__subhead">Role</h4>
            <p>The project team as a whole is around ~50 members, consisting of folks from Design, Functional, Development, Data, Strategy,
              Business, etc. I work closely with the Functional, Data, and Development team on a regular basis to gather requirements and data
              insights, and identify technical constraints and scope definition.
            </p>

            <p>The design team consists of 4 interaction designers, 4 visual designers, 2 design leads and a design director. The team is
              divided into 4 pods, with each pod (consisting of an interaction design and visual designer) being responsible for various
              parts of the platform. I'm a visual designer and my squad has been tasked with redefining the Cart and Checkout experiences.
            </p>

            <p>I work alongside my partner, the interaction designer, to translate business and user requirements into delightful experiences
              that further elevate customers' online shopping experiences.
            </p>

            <h4 class="project__subhead">Process</h4>
            <strong>While all of the artifacts I've worked on are under an NDA, I would be happy to share my design process and discuss the
              project in further detail through an email or call.
            </strong>
