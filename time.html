        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          As I found myself struggling to be productive during Reading Week, I wanted
          to dig deeper to identify the root causes of poor productivity and the best
          way to make the most out of the typical day. Using these findings, I decided
          to design an app that would identify such factors and provide users with
          insightful data that will enable them to make data-driven lifestyle changes
          to improve overall productivity.

        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          Using myself as the primary research subject, I analyzed myself during times of
          poor productivity and narrowed down the root causes to 3 main factors:
        </p>

        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          Distractions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Too much time is being spent on the computer and phone</li>
          <li>Easily distracted and harder to focus after a long period of time</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          Fatigue:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lack of sleep results in a significant decline in productivity</li>
          <li>Fatigue deteriorates one's memory and chances of burning out increases</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          Mood:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Feeling demotivated and discouraged impacts one's drive drastically</li>
          <li>Not the most productive when not at peak time (the time at which one feels
            the most energetic, creative, optimistic and enthusiastic) </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          In terms of being more productive with my time, I gathered the following
          tips:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Plan your day ahead of time to maximize the time you have in the day</li>
          <li>Go about your day by using checklists or to-do lists. This allows you
          to prioritize your tasks and gives you a sense of accomplishment when you
          check a task off your list. It is recommended to limit yourself <br> to 3 tasks
          per day to make your goals more attainable and stray from overwhelming you</li>
          <li>Clear your mind and remove all negativity</li>
          <li>Adopt the 90-30 minute technique or Pomodoro technique </li>
        </ul>

          <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          Since I based this idea on an issue that I personally struggle with, the first
          persona that I created was a university student. The second persona, an office
          worker, was created to further explore potential painpoints and needs.

          <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          From these personas, I was able to identify three common issues that both personas
          are struggling with:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Lack of a means of tracking their daily tasks. As a result, they are
                constantly overwhelmed
            </li>
            <li>Lack of a means of tracking their moodsâ€“As both work in highly stressful
                environments, they are often at the edge of their seats and are generally
                unhappy. They also are not aware of the consequences of sleep deprivation
            </li>
            <li>Wish to be productive but are unsure of how to start</li>
          </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="secondary--subsection">
        <h2 class="secondary--subsection-header project--time-header">workflow</h2>
        <h3 class="secondary--subsection-subhead">how would the users be using this app?</h3>
        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
        To best accommodate for the target users, I flushed out the workflow to ensure that
        it would be as seamlessly integrated into the user's daily life as possible. This
        included figuring out when to prompt the user to track their sleep from the previous
        night, current mood, and top 3 tasks for the day.
        <br></br>
        <img class="secondary--image-asset" src="../images/assets/time/time_workflow.jpg">
        <p class="secondary--caption-content text-center">Workflow of the app</p>

        <br></br>
        It was decided that the user should be asked to track their sleep and prioritize their
        tasks as early as possible, so that the user can use the rest of the day to focus on
        their objectives for the day.
        <br></br>
        We often forget the different moods we feel throughout the day; therefore to ensure that
        these moods are recorded often, the user will be prompted to rate their current mood
        throughout the day at scheduled intervals.
