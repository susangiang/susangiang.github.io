            <h4 class="project__subhead">The Problem</h4>
            <h4 class="project__subhead__description">Struggling with low productivity</h4>
            <p>Low productivity is often attributed by fatigue, mood, inability to focus, easy
              access to distracting devices, and more. The problem with many existing solutions
              that tackle low productivity (such as pomodoro cycle trackers and sleep trackers)
              is that they make the assumption that the aforementioned factors are independent variables.
              This is often not the case, as all of these factors contribute to one's overall
              performance during the day. Therefore, further exploration of how to better represent
              the impacts of the factors in everyday life on productivity was needed.
            </p>
            <h4 class="project__subhead">Role and Tools</h4>
            <p>This is a personal project that I did independently–I carried out all aspects of the
              projects, from the research phase to the final design.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Pen and paper for ideation and sketches</li>
              <li>Sketch for interface design</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="project__subhead">Research</h4>
            <h4 class="project__subhead__description">Talking to students, in and out of their comfort zones</h4>
            <p>
              To arrive at a viable solution, it was important to understand the actual users of the
              product. Being a student that often struggles with maximizing productivity, I wanted to
              validate the pain points that I personally had by conducting contextual inquiry interviews
              with other university students. The interviews consisted of asking subjects about their
              day-to-day lives, habits, and study routines while they were in a study environment
              of their choice. In addition to gaining empathy, speaking with students in the environment
              in which they studied in allowed me to observe how their surroundings played a role in
              their study habits.
            </p>

            <p>From the interviews, their biggest pain points were identified to be:
            <ul>
              <li>Having to balance between large amount of tasks to do for the day</li>
              <li>Determining what best works for them on a given day, as their overall
                productivity is influenced by many factors (amount of sleep and mood, to name a few)</li>
              <li>Spending excessive amounts of time during the day on distractions, as attributed by
                social media and easily accessible distracting devices</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Using the findings from the contextual inquiry interviews, I was able to develop a persona that best
              represented the target users. An empathy map for the persona was made and can be seen below:

          <h4 class="project__subhead">The Solution</h4>
          <h4 class="project__subhead__description">Allowing students to build habits, prioritize tasks, and make data-driven lifestyle changes </h4>
            <p>The resulting design was a mobile app that collects, monitors, and tracks user behaviours
              and provides weekly insights that encourages positive lifestyle changes moving forward.

                  <h4>My Tasks</h4>
                  <p>Students are often overwhelmed by the sheer amount of tasks they need to
                    accomplish for the day, inducing stressed behaviours and demotivates students
                    as they struggle to juggle between which tasks to complete first. To tackle
                    this problem, students are prompted to enter their top three tasks to do for
                    the day. This teaches them to better prioritize their tasks, reducing work
                    overload and establishes focus for the day. Students can also use the built-in
                    Pomodoro tracker to track how much time is spent on completing each task.

                  <h4>Mood Tracker</h4>
                  <p>Amidst a busy day, students are typically out of tune with how they feel
                    throughout the day;  therefore to ensure that these moods are recorded often,
                    students will be prompted to rate their current mood throughout the day at
                    scheduled intervals.

                  <h4>Week in Review</h4>
                  <p>To encourage positive lifestyle changes for students, a weekly report containing
                    insights as inferred by the student’s habits and internet usage is presented.
                    This allows students to be aware of and recognize the best conditions in which
                    they work most effectively in, where this newfound knowledge can be used to adopt
                    better habits for the week to come.

            <p>As part of a design exercise to challenge myself, I also created a hypothetical landing page
              for this app. Designing this landing page has allowed me to be more mindful of typgraphy,
              layout, and copy.
