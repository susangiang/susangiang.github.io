            <h4 class="project__subhead">The Problem</h4>
            <h4 class="project__subhead__description">Struggling with low productivity</h4>
            <p>Low productivity is often attributed by fatigue, mood, inability to focus, easy
              access to distracting devices, and more. The problem with many existing solutions
              that tackle low productivity (such as pomodoro cycle trackers and sleep trackers)
              is that they make the assumption that aforementioned factors are independent variables.
              This is often not the case, as all of these factors contribute to one's overall
              performance during the day.
            </p>
            <p><b>ðŸ’¡Opportunity</b>: How might we improve the productivity of individuals by providing meaningful
              insights into their typical workflows and promoting data-driven decision making?</p>
            <h4 class="project__subhead">Role and Tools</h4>
            <p>This is a personal project that I did independently â€“ I carried out all aspects of the
              projects, from the research phase to the final design.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Pen and paper for ideation and sketches</li>
              <li>Sketch for interface design</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="project__subhead">Research</h4>
            <h4 class="project__subhead__description">Talking to students, in and out of their comfort zones</h4>
            <p>
              To arrive at a viable solution, it was important to understand the actual users of the
              product. Being a student that often struggles with maximizing productivity, I wanted to
              validate the pain points that I personally had by conducting contextual inquiry interviews
              with other university students. The interviews consisted of asking subjects about their
              day-to-day lives, habits, and study routines while they were in a studying environment
              of their choice. In addition to gaining empathy, speaking with students in the environment
              in which they studied in allowed me to observe how their surroundings played a role in
              their study habits.
            </p>

            <p>From the interviews, it was identified that their biggest pain points were:
            <ul>
              <li>Having to balance between large amount of tasks to do for the day</li>
              <li>Determining what best works for them on a given day</li>
              <li>Spending excessive amounts of time during the day on distractions, as attributed by
                social media and easily accessible distracting devices</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Observations made:
            <ul>
              <li>Preferred to use their laptops when studying</li>
              <li>Most preferred to use their mobile devices during breaks</li>
              <li>Poor self awareness of mental well-being</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Using the findings from the contextual inquiry interviews, I was able to develop a persona that best
              represented the target users. An empathy map for the persona was made and can be seen below:
            </p>

              <img class="subsection__image--full-width" src="../images/assets/time/time_persona_student.jpg">
              <p class="subsection--caption-content text-center">Empathy map for Leah, a university student</p>

              <p><b>The University Student, Leah</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Always on the go</li>
                <li>Often overwhelmed with the workload</li>
                <li>Stressed, uses social media as an outlet</li>
                <li>Easily distracted</li>
                <li>Inefficient studying; plays by ear often</li>
              </ul>
              </p>

              <p>With this persona in mind, I came up with a list of user goals.</p>
              <p><b>As a user, I want to:</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>Ensure I am getting the sleep I need</li>
                  <li>Know what my time is being spent on, whether it be on distractions or tasks</li>
                  <li>Increase my self awareness and look after my mental health</li>
                  <li>Learn to prioritize to avoid being overwhelmed</li>
                  <li>Focus on the task at hand and study without disruptions</li>
                </ul>
              </p>

          <h4 class="project__subhead">Options Considered</h4>
          <p>For the next step, I began to brainstorm the various forms that this solution could come in and
            listed out the pros and cons of each option. Options considered include a Google Chrome extension, a desktop app,
            a mobile app, and lastly a mobile app + Google Chrome extension duo.
          </p>
          <p>In the end, I chose the last option (mobile app + Google Chrome extension duo) because it was the most appropriate
            for the target users. Based on the interviews conducted, it was validated that university students use both their
            laptops and mobile devices for roughly the same amount of time, but for different purposes. Students preferred to
            use their laptops during studying because of the larger screens and faster access to information. However, students
            would switch to using their mobile devices during breaks, as they are more portable and can be used as the students
            go on a quick stroll. For that reason, it was determined that using both a mobile app and Chrome extension would be
            most accurate in recording the amount of time spent on distractions and tasks, given the two scenarios. The mobile
            app would also be able to capture time spent on apps that are not available on desktops, such as Snapchat.
          </p>

          <h4 class="project__subhead">Workflow</h4>
          <p>Due to time constraints, I decided to focus on the mobile experience and created a draft of what the experience would
            look like. This allowed me to get a high level overview of the app features and also helped with determining the
            information hierarchy.
          </p>

          <p class="subsection--caption-content text-center">App workflow</p>

          <h4 class="project__subhead">Initial Wireframes</h4>
          <p>Next, I dived straight into sketching some initial wireframes for what the core features would look like. I explored
            with different input types, design patterns, and data visualizations.
          </p>

          <p class="subsection--caption-content text-center">Initial wireframes</p>

          <h4 class="project__subhead">Prototyping & Testing</h4>
          <p>After some refinement, I created medium-fidelity mockups for the end-to-end experience of the solution and prototyped
            it on InVision (<a href="https://invis.io/Y6FZO7EUVA5#/280882735_Splash_-_Value_Prop_1">view prototype here</a>). I used
            this prototype to conduct user testing with several fellow classmates and recorded their feedback and thoughts as they
            navigated about the app.
          </p>
          <p>Some sections of the app, such as the <i>Insights</i> screen, were intentionally left blank; this was so that when users
            landed on said sections, I would take the opportunity to ask the users what they expected to see. This was especially
            helpful for determining the best way to visualize the users' data on the <i>Insights</i> screen.

          <p><b>Some feedback that I received were:</b>
            <ul>
              <li>"Account setup is lengthy. Do I have to configure my settings?</li>
              <li>"I don't want to do this right now but I also can't seem to skip this"</li>
              <li>"I want to be able to see how today's progress differs from yesterday's and the day before"</li>
              <li>"I would like to see my progress over a long period of time, like a month"</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h4 class="project__subhead">The Solution</h4>
          <h4 class="project__subhead__description">Allowing students to build habits, prioritize tasks, and make data-driven lifestyle changes </h4>
            <p>After iterating based on the feedback received, the resulting design was a mobile app that
              collects, monitors, and tracks user behaviours. It also provides weekly insights that encourages positive lifestyle changes moving forward.
            </p>

                  <h4>My Tasks</h4>
                  <p>Students are often overwhelmed by the sheer amount of tasks they need to
                    accomplish for the day, inducing stressed behaviours and demotivates students
                    as they struggle to juggle between what tasks to complete first. To tackle
                    this problem, students are prompted to enter their top three tasks to do for
                    the day. This teaches them to better prioritize their tasks, reducing work
                    overload and establishes focus for the day. Students can also use the built-in
                    Pomodoro tracker to track how much time is spent on completing each task.

                  <h4>Mood Tracker</h4>
                  <p>Amidst a busy day, students are typically out of tune with how they feel
                    throughout the day;  therefore to ensure that these moods are recorded often,
                    students will be prompted to rate their current mood throughout the day at
                    cheduled intervals.

                    insights as inferred by the studentâ€™s habits and internet usage is presented.
                    This allows students to be aware of and recognize the best conditions in which
                    they work most effectively in, where this newfound knowledge can be used to adopt
                    better habits for the week to come. An interactive graph displaying the student's progress
                    for the last week is also shown for easy comparison.

            <p>As part of a design exercise to challenge myself, I also created a hypothetical landing page
              for this app. Designing this landing page has allowed me to be more mindful of typgraphy,
              layout, and copy.

            <h4 class="project__subhead">Next Steps</h4>
              <p>Looking back, there are several changes that I would make to improve the mobile experience:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Passive, rather than reactive.</b> The solution takes a more passive approach in the sense that it may still be unclear what students can do next to improve
                their productivity. A possible solution to address this may be providing students with personalized and actionable tips
                pertaining to their specific habits that they may adopt moving forward.</li>
                <li><b>Moods are subjective.</b> As a predefined mood is assigned to every numerical value on the linear scale on the Mood prompt, users
                may not necessarily agree with the assignments, resulting in skewed responses. To address this, I would remove the predefined moods
                and provide users the option of adding a personal note each time they rate their mood. That way, there is context into why they are
                feeling the way they are at a point in time.</li>
                <li><b>Lack of long term insights.</b> Currently, students can only see their progress over the last week. As noted during user testing,
                having the ability to observe how the user's progress has evolved over a longer period of time is essential in the development of
                long term habits. To address this, I would do further exploration into how users can check their progress for the long term</li>
              <p>Lastly, the next step is the design of the Chrome extension and envisioning how that experience would look like.
