          Sprout is a leading Corporate Wellness Engagement platform that
          allows corporations to promote healthier and happier lifestyles for
          their employees, leading to higher productivity and overall
          satisfaction while on the job. Employees can use the Sprout platform
          to track activities, join challenges, and join communities consisting
          of employees that share similar interests.

          For this project, I worked alongside the lead designer and two
          software developers. I was tasked with designing the overall flow and
          experience of the survey, for both web and mobile, to ensure that it
          is intuitive to use, quick to complete, and allows Sprout users to
          reap the benefits to its fullest.

        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          The Sprout Health Risk Assessment (HRA) is a survey in which users
          are asked a series of questions regarding their health and lifestyle
          habits. The intention of the survey is to determine risk factors that
          they may be especially prone to, and to provide recommendations on how
          they can reduce such risks, whether it be exercise suggestions or
          simply incorporating meditation into their daily routines. The HRA is
          a completely new feature; the major design challenges consisted of
          designing the flow of the actual assessment and determining how to incorporate the
          feature into the current state of the product to maintain consistency
          throughout the platform.

          The goal is to educate users of their health risks that they may
          be unaware of, and to provide them with recommendations on how they can
          mitigate such risks for a healthier and happier lifestyle.

        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          Applying my knowledge of best practices for the design of web and
          mobile applications, I designed the screens for both experiences,
          presented them to the team, and after many iterations over a 1.5
          month period, provided hi-fidelity mockups to the developers for
          implementation.
        </br>
        </br>
          While I cannot share the mockups, the following are a series of fun icons
          and illustrations that I made on Sketch to accompany each screen to make
          onboarding more of an exciting endeavour and less of a chore.

        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          Onboarding is a pretty big deal. Like a first date, first impressions
          are lasting and sculpts the remainder of one’s experience. Some
          drastic changes were made to our onboarding flow, from the shifting
          of existing screens to the addition of the HRA, and we would be very
          interested in understanding how we have affected our users as a result,
          positively and negatively. Once the new onboarding flow makes a
          public release, some questions I would like our data to answer are:
        </p>

        <h3 class="secondary--subsection-subhead">
          Are users completing their HRA during their onboarding?
        </h3>
        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          If not, which screens are the major drop-off points and what are
          possible reasons why they are choosing not to complete it?
        </p>

        <h3 class="secondary--subsection-subhead">
          Has the HRA feature encouraged the user to be more active in their
          lives?
        </h3>
        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          Since the HRA score updates based on user step data collected, do
          users feel motivated to exercise more to improve their score? This can
          be determined by monitoring the user’s daily step data and activity
          tracking patterns.
        </p>

        <h3 class="secondary--subsection-subhead">
          Are users more aware of what features our platform offers, now that
          we have added value proposition screens, and are they taking the
          initiative to visit the respective pages on the platform?
