          <div class="project-body">
            <p>I interned at Sprout as a Product Designer in Fall 2016.</p>
            <p>Sprout is a leading Corporate Wellness Engagement platform that
            allows corporations to promote healthier and happier lifestyles for
            their employees, leading to higher productivity and overall
            satisfaction while on the job. Employees can use the Sprout platform
            to track activities, join challenges, and join communities consisting
            of employees that share similar interests.
            </p>
          <h4 class="project__subhead">The Problem</h4>
          <h4 class="project__subhead__description">Identifying health risks</h4>
            <p>Sprout is a leading corporate wellness engagement platform that allows
              corporations to promote healthier and happier lifestyles for their employees
              by tracking activities and joining challenges and communities. The Sprout
              Health Risk Assessment (HRA) is a survey that asks users a series of questions
              regarding their health and lifestyles with the intention of determining risks
              and providing recommendations on how to mitigate such risks. Being a completely
              new feature that is to be introduced into the registration flow, the challenge
              was designing the flow and user interfaces of the actual assessment.
            </p>

          <h4 class="project__subhead">Role and Tools</h4>
            <p>For this project, I worked alongside another designer but was primarily
                responsible for designing the workflow, interfaces, and illustrations, for
                both web and mobile (iOS). I also provided high-fidelity mockups to developers
                and worked closely with them to discuss technical feasibility and and ensure
                their implementation of my work was as accurate as possible.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Pen and paper, for ideation and sketches</li>
              <li>Sketch for wireframing, interface design, and illustrations</li>
              <li>InVision for prototyping</li>
            </ul>

          <h4 class="project__subhead">Workflow</h4>
            <p>As stated before, the HRA was going to be added to the existing registration
              flow, as shown below.
            </p>

            <img class="subsection__image--full-width" src="../images/assets/sprout/workflow_old.png">

            <p>Some important points to note for the new feature is the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Clients using the Sprout platform have the option of using the Sprout HRA or an external third party HRA provider</li>
              <li>Sprout allows users the ability to connect select wearables (Garmin, Fitbit, and more) to the platform for automatic data collection. While a wearable is not required to use the platform itself, users must connect a wearable for the platform to collect the data needed (approximately 7 daysâ€™ worth of data) to generate the HRA results</li>
            </ul>

            <p> Given the points listed above, to ensure that all edge cases are covered, I created
              the workflow below to identify all of the possible scenarios that could occur for a user
              going through the new registration flow.
            </p>

            <img class="subsection__image--full-width" src="../images/assets/sprout/workflow_new.png">

            <h4 class="project__subhead">The Solution</h4>
            <h4 class="project__subhead__description">Guided and engaging questionnaire that accounts for all edge cases</h4>
              <p>The end result was a guided questionnaire that was informative, engaging, and
                easy to digest. The survey was broken down into smaller subsections to avoid information
                overload and provided users with the flexibility of completing what they wanted, when
                they wanted to.
              </p>

                  <div class="subsection-body">
                    <h4>Value Propositions</h4>
                    <p>An important aspect of the registration flow is to provide context to users as
                      to what the platform can offer and how it can benefit them. To accomplish this,
                      value proposition screens were designed for the purpose of educating users and
                      outlining the values of the platform.
                    </p>
                  </div>
                </div>

                <h4>Assessment Questions</h4>
                <p>To avoid information overload, the survey was designed to present every question
                  on a per-question basis. This approach established focus on the current question
                  and prevented users from diverting their attention to other distracting elements.
                  The progress bar, fixed to the top of the modal, indicates the current section and
                  how far along the users are in the survey. This provides users with foresight and
                  motivation to complete the survey.

              </div>

              <h4>Illustrations</h4>
              <p>Lastly, to add to the overall experience of the survey, I created a series of fun
                illustrations to accompany every value proposition, question, and edge case (empty states,
                specifically). These illustrations provide visual context to the information and made the
                survey more digestible as a whole.
