          I was the lead designer in a team of 7 (one designer, five developers,
          and a product manager) throughout all phases of the design process.
          I mainly pushed pixels and led the creative direction of the product
          using user research findings.

        <h3 class="secondary--subsection-subhead">reducing consumer waste</h3>
        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          As of 2012, there are 251 million tonnes of waste in the United States,
          where 35 million tonnes of it are food waste and are often reusable.
          Current methods of disposal include incineration or transportation to
          landfills, which is inefficient, toxic, space consuming, and creates
          pollutant emissions. We wanted to create a solution that would help
          reduce consumer waste in the long run in hopes of creating better, informed
          waste disposal decisions and habits.

        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          To raise environmental awareness and consciousness, children should be
          better educated by making salient the amount of waste they are
          producing, which could affect their future purchasing decisions and
          influence them to adopt proper waste disposal habits as they grow
          older.

          I drew the storyboard to outline the end-to-end experience of using
          the product, from discovering the product and purchasing the physical

          using its features to the user’s benefits.

        <h2 class="secondary--subsection-header project--gg-header">the prototype</h2>
        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          The first prototype was a mobile app with a 5-page interface that
          leverages weight sensing technology and gamification to incentivize
          children to reduce their total waste output. It does this by syncing
          with a weight sensor installed at the bottom of a garbage can and
          awarding more points to the user when the garbage can weight is under
          a certain threshold during garbage collection day. The child can then
          use these points to purchase trees that will be planted in their local
          community on their behalf, which serves as an incentive for the user
          to throw away less waste.

          Applying design heuristics for mobile application design, I made the

        <h3 class="secondary--subsection-subhead">putting our prototype to the test</h3>
        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          The first prototype was tested with a total of five users, two of
          which were users in the target age range and three of which have
          younger siblings within the target range. The prototype was tested on
          an iPad and users were instructed to go through the experience
          outlined in the storyboard I had previously created. They were told
          that their ultimate goal is to plant a tree successfully, without
          telling them how they could achieve it on the app.
        </p>
        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          The tasks to be performed were the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Setting up the actual sensor(unboxing the garbage can and attaching the weight sensor)</li>
          <li>Log onto mobile app</li>
          <li>Check app after the waste in the garbage can has been collected by a garbage truck (users are told to pretend that some time has passed since setting up in Task 1)</li>
          <li>Achieve their ultimate goal of planting a tree successfully</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="secondary--subsection">
        <h2 class="secondary--subsection-header project--gg-header">results</h2>
        <h3 class="secondary--subsection-subhead">the product wasn’t as intuitive and helpful as we hoped it would be</h3>
        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          The first prototype had an emphasis on presenting a data-based
          analysis for the user’s garbage disposal. Since we aimed for our
          prototype to reduce waste through education and the cultivation of
          good habits, we made the initial assumption that providing trends and
          data through our product would be useful as users would be able to
          reflect upon it and adjust their garbage disposal habits accordingly.
          We soon realized during user testing that this prototype did not work
          well for our target audience of younger children.
        </p>
        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          The following feedback was given by most of the users during user testing:
        </p>

        <h3 class="secondary--subsection-subhead">“How does the app work?”</h3>
        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          All of the users had a difficult time onboarding and understanding the
          value of the app–there was not enough guidance to allow them to reap
          the app’s benefits to its fullest
        </p>

        <h3 class="secondary--subsection-subhead">“How is this a game?”</h3>
        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          It is difficult to tell whether the app is a game or not, and how it
          is supposed to reduce waste. The test subjects that were in the
          targeted age range did not understand the connection between earning
          points in the game and using these points to plant a tree in real
          life; it did not appeal to them whatsoever.
        </p>

        <h3 class="secondary--subsection-subhead">“Is this really an app for children?”</h3>
        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          Test subjects with younger siblings thought that the sophisticated
          graphs and statistics on the app would not be understood by their
          siblings. They also thought that there was too much text and not
          enough child-friendly visual elements to keep them engaged and
          motivated.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="secondary--subsection">
        <h2 class="secondary--subsection-header project--gg-header">iterating</h2>
        <h3 class="secondary--subsection-subhead">back to the drawing board</h3>
        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          Based on the feedback received from user testing, we made the following design decisions:
        </p>

        <h3 class="secondary--subsection-subhead">“How does the app work?”</h3>
        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          It was very important to us that the user understands the value of
          the app and how they can take advantage of everything that it has to
          offer. To make onboarding a smoother process and provide the user
          with more context on the app itself, we decided to include a
          mandatory tutorial modal appear upon first log-in; the tutorial
          consists of several screens that outlines the purpose of each page of
          the app and how the user can interact with it. We have also decided
          to include a Help modal that the user can access at the bottom of
          every page for further assistance in the future.
        </p>

        <h3 class="secondary--subsection-subhead">“How is this a game?”</h3>
        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          As great as planting trees on behalf of the user in the real world
          sounds, it wasn’t motivating enough for our target users; we found
          that children preferred virtual games as opposed to some reward in
          real life. As a result, we replaced the ‘Plant My Tree’ screen with
          ‘My Garden’, a feature that allows users to plant seeds and grow
          them into different trees in a virtual interface. The user can
          redeem the points that they earn in the app to buy seeds and use the
          toolbox in the game to cultivate and water their seeds into trees.
        </p>

        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          To further gamify the app, we added a ‘Community’ screen, which is
          essentially a leaderboard that allows users to track their score and
          other metrics against friends that they have added to their network.
          This introduces a social aspect into the app, where users can interact
          with their friends and are also strongly incentivized by competition
          amongst their peers.
        </p>

        <h3 class="secondary--subsection-subhead">“Is this really an app for children?”</h3>
        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          The graphs on the Dashboard were difficult for children to understand.
          To eliminate the use of confusing numbers and complicated graphs,
          I redesigned the screen to be as simple as possible by using a garbage
          bin icon to represent the user’s actual garbage bin at home. As more
          waste is added to the bin, the weight sensor would sense the increase
          in weight, which results in an increase to the size of the garbage
          bin on the app and even changes colours to indicate warning levels
          once a certain weight threshold has been reached.
        </p>

        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          The scoring system was also revamped; previously, the user was
          only awarded points once a week (whenever the garbage bin was emptied
          during weekly waste collection). We found that allocating points this
          way relied heavily on the user’s patience and was simply too long of
          a wait for the user to want to continue using the app on a daily
          basis. Therefore, the new scoring system continuously rewards the user
          with a certain number of points if they can keep the weight of the
          waste below a specific threshold. Once that threshold is reached,
          the user would continue to earn points, but they would receive a
          lower amount. This is because we believed that scoring should
          provide instant and positive feedback to the user; children did not
          like to wait and losing points would strongly discourage them from
          using the app again.
        </p>

        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          This solution allows the user to understand the correlation between
          an increase in waste weight and the number of points they would earn,
          thus motivating them to reduce the amount of waste they dispose of in
          the long run.
        </p>

        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          To make the UI appear more child-friendly, I increased the use of
          iconography and reduced text usage within the screens. The main
          navigation was also moved to the bottom of the screen to comply with
          iOS conventions and accommodate for the smaller hand sizes of
          children.

      <div class="secondary--subsection">
        <h2 class="secondary--subsection-header project--gg-header">the final solution</h2>
        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          Based on the results of feedback received from user testing, the final
          solution was a 4-page interface mobile app with a new scoring scheme
          that awards additional points to the user for keeping the garbage can
          at a low weight for as long as possible, while awarding less points to
          the user if the weight increases. The gamification aspect was also
          changed to allow the child to use these points to purchase seeds and
          tools for planting trees in their virtual garden, which serves as
          motivation to continue using the app.
