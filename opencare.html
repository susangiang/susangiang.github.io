          <h4 class="project__subhead">Context</h4>
          <div class="project-body">
            <p>Founded in 2012, Opencare is a healthcare startup with a mission to make healthcare more personable, approachable, and accessible.
              Patients are connected with dentalcare providers and the interactions that take place in between are redefined through a streamlined
              booking platform.
            </p>

            <p>To successfully book a dental appointment with a practice, patients must first fill out a short questionnaire regarding their
              dental history, preferences, and insurance information. The platform then provides a list of Opencare vetted practices that best
              cater to the patient. From a practice's profile, the patient is able to either instantly book an open timeslot with a practice
              (through the Instabook feature) or request an appointment (non-Instabook), in which the practice will be notified and the process
              of scheduling an appointment begins.
            </p>

            <p>We learned that back/forth communications between patients and practices are a hindering and time consuming process for both parties.
              We knew that addressing this roadblock was necessary to reduce the amount of effort and time wasted.
            </p>

            <h4 class="project__subhead">Role</h4>
            <p>I was the sole designer on the Growth team, focused on understanding the barriers to entry and running rapid experiments to
              drive higher revenue and key metrics. Over the course of 2 weeks, I worked closely alongside the growth product manager to
              develop a deep understanding of patient and practice pains through user interviews and data analysis. I also communicated with
              the engineers throughout the duration of the project; from identifying constraints and technical limitations to ensuring accurate
              implementation of the final designs after handoff.
            </p>

            <h4 class="project__subhead">Process</h4>
            <div class="project-body">
              <p>While all of the artifacts I've worked on are under an NDA, I would be happy to share my design process and discuss the
                project in further detail through an email or call.
              </p>
