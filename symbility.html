          <div class="project-body">
            <p>This past summer, I was a Product Design intern at Symbility Intersect.
            <br></br>Symbility Intersect is an agency specializing in mobile and IoT
              product strategy, design thinking, and engineering excellence.
              It delivers the tools, agile process, and product management
              expertise to clients looking to build with the speed of startups.
              Their clients include Canada's largest companies including Northbridge
              Insurance, CIBC, TD Bank, LCBO, Indigo, Mastercard Canada, and more.
            </p>
            <p>Throughout my 4-month internship, I was given the opportunity to take
              ownership over multiple projects, from designing end-to-end experiences of
              major platform features, creating illustrations and icons, to independently
              assembling a developer-ready, AODA-compliant styleguide.
              <br>
              </br>
              While I cannot share the work I did, the following are some lessons learned
              from the projects I was on and wisdom given to me by my mentor throughout
              the term.
