          <div class="project-body">
            <p>This past summer, I was a Product Design intern at Symbility Intersect.
            <br></br>Symbility Intersect is an agency specializing in mobile and IoT
              product strategy, design thinking, and engineering excellence for clients
              looking to build at the speed of startups. Their clients include Canada's
              largest companies including Northbridge Insurance, CIBC, TD Bank, LCBO,
              Indigo, Mastercard Canada, and more.
            </p>
            <p>Throughout my 4-month internship, I had the opportunity to take ownership
              over multiple projects, from designing end-to-end experiences of major
              platform features, creating illustrations and icons, to independently
              assembling a developer-ready, AODA-compliant styleguide for a big player
              in the human resources services and technology industry.
              <br>
              </br>
              While I cannot share the work I did, the following are some lessons learned
              from the projects I was on and wisdom given to me by my mentor throughout
              the term.
            </p>

                  <h4>Designing With Intent</h4>
                  <p>With complex features, comes complex interfaces. Going through
                    several design iterations of interfaces for multiple major key
                    features on an insurance claims platform has made me more mindful
                    of how to lay out elements strategically so that the interface
                    is intuitive and easy to interact with.

                  <h4>Asking Questions</h4>
                  <p>At a design agency, it is pretty common to hop onto projects
                    that have already been kickstarted or are in a later stage in
                    the design process. I have learned to constantly challenge what has been
                    presented to me and question everything.

                  <h4>Be Curious</h4>
                  <p>It was exciting to work for an agency where many projects were
                    going on simultaneously. Though I didn’t get the chance to touch
                    on every single project, being naturally curious about what neighbouring
                    designers worked on provided me with exposure on the different types of
                    design problems that other industries face and allowed me to contribute
                    in implicit ways.

                  <h4>Taking a Step Back</h4>
                  <p>Projects under tight deadlines and immense pressure are not unusual
                    for agencies. I occasionally found myself stuck on a design problem
                    that did not seem to yield any elegant solutions. In situations like
                    this, it is extremely helpful to take a step back and look at the
                    problem holistically to realign user needs and end goals.

                  <h4>Owning Your Shit</h4>
                  <p>At Symbility, Product Review runs on a biweekly basis. Product reviews
                    were a chance for designers to present their work, and provide and receive
                    valuable feedback from other designers and product managers. Through
                    numerous design-walkthroughs in client meetings and product reviews,
                    I act as the owner of my work and take pride in my deliverables.

                  <h4>Practice Makes Closer-to-Perfect</h4>
                  <p>One of my biggest goals this co-op term was to improve my visual design skills.
                    During my internship, I was given the opportunity to perform plenty of visual
                    design explorations that push my creative boundaries, while adhering to brand
                    guidelines.
