          <h4 class="project__subhead">Context</h4>
          <div class="project-body">
            <p>Over the course of 8 weeks, I worked with a Fortune 500 transportation company to redefine how clerks do their job and
              increase visibility into the business' day-to-day operations and customers. Currently, requests and all subsequent data
              are processed and stored using an extremely complex and intricate system––tens of thousands of requests are submitted on a daily basis.
              We learned, from stakeholder interviews, of the inefficiencies that make it challenging to resolve requests in a timely
              manner and the lack of metrics on both a micro and macro level, hindering the success of the business.
            </p>

            <h4 class="project__subhead">Role</h4>
            <p>I worked closely with an interaction design lead to define the problem/scope, ideate and iterate on concepts and wireframes,
              execute on visual design, and establish a design system that would lay the foundation for subsequent stages of the project.
              Other members of the team included the project lead, technical architecture lead, business analyst, and testing lead.
            </p>

            <h4 class="project__subhead">Process</h4>
            <strong>While all of the artifacts I've worked on are under an NDA, I would be happy to share my design process and discuss the
              project in further detail through an email or call.
            </strong>
