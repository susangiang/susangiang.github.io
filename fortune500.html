          <h2>Context</h2>
          <p>
            I worked with a Fortune 500 transportation company to redefine how clerks do their job and increase visibility into the business' day-to-day operations and customers. Getting things shipped from Point A to Point B is no easy feat. Every shipment begins with a shipment request, a document containing shipment details that is submitted to the transport company. Currently, requests and all subsequent data are processed and stored using an extremely complex and intricate system––tens of thousands of requests are submitted on a daily basis. We learned of the inefficiencies that make it challenging to resolve requests in a timely manner and the lack of metrics on both a micro and macro level, hindering the success of the business.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project involved a redesign of one major component of the shipment process. The work delivered in this phase of work would act as the foundational pieces for future phases, where the subsequent stages of the shipment process will undergo transformation.

          <h2>Role</h2>
          <p>
            Over the course of 8 weeks, I worked closely with an interaction design lead to define the problem/scope, ideate and iterate on concepts and wireframes, execute on visual design, and establish a design system that would lay the foundation for subsequent stages of the project. Other members of the team included 2 project leads, 1 technical architecture lead, 2 business analysts, and 1 testing lead.

          <h2>Process</h2>
          <p class="font--bold">
            While all of the artifacts I've worked on are under an NDA, I would be happy to share my design process and discuss the project in further detail through an email or call.
          </p>
          <p>
            At a high level, some of the things we did included:
            <ul>
              <li>Stakeholder interviews and synthesis</li>
              <li>Sketching and wireframes</li>
              <li>Built a component library with documentation from scratch</li>
              <li>Hi-fidelity designs of key screens</li>
              <li>Working prototype</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
