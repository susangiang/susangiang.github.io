          <h4 class="project__subhead">The Story</h4>
          <div class="project-body">
            <p>I interned at AIR MILES as a Product Designer in Winter 2016.</p>
            <p>AIR MILES is Canada’s largest coalition loyalty program, with more than ten
              million active Collector accounts and approximately two-thirds of Canadian households
              participating in the program. Collectors earn reward Miles by shopping
              with select sponsors, which can be used to redeem free flights, hotel accommodations,
              car bookings, merchandise, and more. AIR MILES has over 100 sponsors, including
              American Express, Toys R Us, Amazon, and more.
            </p>
          <h4 class="project__subhead">The Problem</h4>
          <h4 class="project__subhead__description">The existing car and hotel booking experiences are drastically hurting conversion tunnels</h4>
            <p>Issues with the AIR MILES Travel booking experiences (flight, car, and hotel) is one,
              if not the greatest, driver of calls to the call centre, with wait times of up to 4 hours
              during peak seasons for travel. As a result, AIR MILES needed a redesign of the car and
              hotel booking experience to address the usability issues that are impacting the conversion
              tunnel and maintain consistency across the platform following the recent redesign of the
              flight booking experience.
            </p>

          <h4 class="project__subhead">Role and Tools</h4>
          <p>For this project, I worked alongside another designer and a UX researcher. I was responsible
            for conducting heuristic evaluations and competitive analyses and worked closely with the UX
            researcher to develop plans for user testing and focus group sessions. I also designed and
            prototyped interfaces based on the findings and worked closely collaborated with the developers
            to ensure their implementation of my work was as accurate as possible.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pen and paper, for ideation, sketches, and user research</li>
            <li>Photoshop for interface design</li>
            <li>Axure for prototyping</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="project__subhead">Research</h4>
          <h4 class="project__subhead__description">Heuristic evaluations, competitive analyses, and lots of conversations with users and call centre employees</h4>
          <p>To gain insight into the state of the art, I applied the following research methods to identify
            the areas of improvement for the current experience.
          </p>

          <h4>Heuristic Evaluation</h4>
          <p>I first performed a heuristic evaluation of the existing car and hotel booking experiences
            against Jakob Nielsen’s design heuristics to identify usability issues. Some findings that
            came out of the evaluation included poor error recovery and visibility of certain page elements.
          </p>

          <h4>User Testing</h4>
          <p>Next, I conducted user testing with active AIR MILES Collectors to observe and understand how
            they actually interacted with the platform. To accomplish this, a total of seven Collectors
            were invited to the AIR MILES office. These Collectors varied in age (late 20s to late 60s)
            and familiarity with technology (inexperienced with use of computers to expert users) and were
            a good representation of the diverse range of Collectors that continue to collect Miles today.
          </p>

          <p>The objective of user testing was to determine the following:</p>
          <p>Comprehension</p>
          <ul>
            <li>On car and hotel booking details (search, location of car, map, insurance, fees)</li>
            <li>On navigating throughout the end-to-end booking experience</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Ease of Use</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ability to enter a valid search request</li>
            <li>Ability to select a car/hotel nearby the arrival location</li>
            <li>Ability to complete the booking process without guidance</li>
          </ul>

          <p>One of the biggest findings from the user testing sessions was the fact that 7 out of 7
             Collectors were not aware of the map feature existed within the search results. We also
             verified that maps are a critical feature for selecting a car rental location, as some
             Collectors stated that they would not proceed with booking if they did not visually see
             the pick-up location relative to their entered destination.
           </p>

           <h4>Focus Groups</h4>
           <p>To further validate pain points of Collectors, my team and I drove down to the Care Centre
             to organize a focus group with five Customer Care Specialists. These specialists understand
             the needs of our Collectors very well, as they hear about the frustrations and concerns of
             our customers on a daily basis. Speaking with the specialists that deal directly with Collectors
             allowed us to gain valuable insight into potential issues that may not have been obvious to
             spot in other UX research methods.
           </p>

           <p>From the focus group sessions, we learned that Collectors often do not complete a booking
             because AIR MILES does not actually accept prepaid credit cards as a valid payment option,
             a fact that only comes to the Collector’s attention at the very end of the flow (when they
             are prompted to enter their payment information!). We also learned that a significant portion
             of calls to the centre were from Collectors confirming their bookings–there is up to a 24-hour
             delay on confirmation emails, but this information was not displayed on the platform either.
           </p>

           <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
           <p>Lastly, I conducted competitive analyses of our competitors and other existing car and hotel
             booking platforms to identify the latest web usability trends in the travel industry.
           </p>

           <img class="subsection__image--full-width" src="../images/assets/air_miles/competitive_analysis.jpg">
           <p class="subsection--caption-content text-center">Some competitors that were analyzed included Expedia, TripAdvisor, Kayak, and Enterprise</p>

           <p>Using the findings acquired from the methods listed above, I was able to discover emerging
             themes and patterns that played an integral role in whether or not the Collector completed
             their booking successfully. I then organized the findings into six major themes: technical
             bugs, insufficient search results, usability/findability issues, booking flow issues, error
             handling issues, and overall comprehension.
           </p>

           <h4 class="project__subhead">The Solution</h4>
           <p>Increasing visbility of the map feature on the search results page was one of the most
             important items to address. In the previous design, the map was collapsed and had a small
             link titled "View map" on the far right side of a thin grey rectangle. For better visibility,
             the final design had the map expanded by default, and the "View map" link was made considerably
             larger and more noticeable by adding an accompanying location "pin" icon to the right of it
             to indicate that the map view can be toggled.
           </p>

           <img class="subsection__image--full-width" src="../images/assets/air_miles/AM_map.gif">
           <p class="subsection--caption-content text-center">Final design for default search results with expanded map</p>

           <p>We also eliminated the use of vague error messaging in search results.
           Previously, when there are no car or hotels available based on the
           user’s entered criteria, a message simply telling the user to modify
           their search criteria and try again was presented. Playing
           on the error prevention design heuristic, the redesigned errors were
           made to be more informative and provided users with plausible
           explanations as to why an error occured, and how they can recover
           from it.
