        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          I worked alongside a team consisting of another UX designer, a
          UX researcher, and software developers that implemented the proposed
          design recommendations. For this project, I got the opportunity to
          execute and assist with several UX research methods (heuristic
          evaluation, user testing, focus groups, and competitive analyses) and
          provided recommendations based on trends that were observed from the
          findings.

        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          Issues with the AIR MILES Travel booking experiences (flight, car,
          and hotel) is one, if not the greatest, driver of calls to the call
          centre. With a limited number of Customer Care Specialists at the Care
          centre, wait times are high and the volume of calls are drastically
          larger during peak seasons for travel. Following a recent redesign of
          the flight booking experience on www.airmiles.ca, a redesign of the
          car and hotel booking experience was needed to maintain consistency
          across the platform and also address any usability issues that
          Collectors have encountered during their booking, resulting in a
          decline of successful car and hotel bookings.

        <h3 class="secondary--subsection-subhead">Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          For this project, I first performed a heuristic evaluation of the
          existing car and hotel booking experience to identify any usability
          issues that I personally encountered. I found this evaluation
          valuable, as I was not a Collector of Miles prior to working for
          AIR MILES; therefore I was able to assess the workflow with a fresh
          pair of eyes and go through the experience as a Collector who is
          unfamiliar with the process.
        </p>
        <h3 class="secondary--subsection-subhead">User Testing</h3>
        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          A total of seven Collectors were invited to the AIR MILES office to
          further identify common pain points that are potentially leading
          causes of unsuccessful bookings. These Collectors varied in age
          (late 20s to late 60s) and familiarity with technology (inexperienced
          with use of computers to expert users) and were a good representation
          of the wide range of Collectors that continue to collect Miles today.
        </p>
        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          The user testing was conducted to determine the following:
        </p>
        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          Comprehension:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>On car and hotel booking details (search, location of car, map, insurance, fees)</li>
          <li> On navigating the end-to-end booking experience</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          Ease of Use:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ability to enter a valid search request</li>
          <li>Ability to select a car/hotel nearby the arrival location</li>
          <li>Ability to complete the booking process without guidance</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="secondary--subsection-subhead">Focus Groups</h3>
        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          I, along with the UX Director and UX Researcher, drove down to the
          AIR MILES call centre (Care) to organize a focus group with five
          Customer Care Specialists. These specialists understand the needs of
          our Collectors very well, as they hear about the frustrations and
          concerns of our customers on a daily basis. Speaking with the
          specialists that deal directly with Collectors allowed us to gain
          valuable insight into potential issues that may not have been obvious
          to spot in other UX research methods.
        </p>

        <h3 class="secondary--subsection-subhead">Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          I had also conducted competitive analyses of our competitors and other
          existing car and hotel booking companies to identify the latest web
          usability trends in the travel industry.
        </p>
        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          Using the findings acquired from the heuristic evaluation, user
          testing, focus groups and competitive analyses, I was able to discover
          emerging themes and patterns that played an integral role in whether
          or not the Collector completes their booking successfully. Six major
          themes were observed: technical bugs, insufficient search results,
          usability/findability issues, booking flow issues, error handling
          issues, and overall comprehension.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="secondary--subsection">
        <h2 class="secondary--subsection-header project--am-header">the solution</h2>
        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          During user testing, it was found that 7/7 users were not aware that
          there was a map feature that was included in the search results; we
          were able to verify that maps are a critical feature for selecting a
          car rental location as some users stated that they would not proceed
          with booking if they did not visually see the pick-up location relative
          to their entered destination. In the previous design, the map was collapsed
          and had a small hyperlink-blue link titled ‘View map’ on the far right
          side of a thin grey rectangle. It was evident that due to poor
          visibility, the users could not locate the map feature. To improve
          visibility, we designed the search results so that the map view is
          expanded by default, and the ‘View maps’ text was made considerably
          larger and bolder and was also accompanied by a location icon to the
          right of it to indicate that the map view can be toggled.
        </p>

        <img class="secondary--image-asset" src="../images/assets/air_miles/error_nocar.jpg">
        <p class="secondary--subsection-content text-center">No car rental locations that match user’s search</p>
        <img class="secondary--image-asset" src="../images/assets/air_miles/error_no_miles.jpg">
        <p class="secondary--subsection-content text-center">Not enough Miles to redeem a hotel</p>

        <p class="secondary--subsection-content">
          We also eliminated the use of vague error messaging in search results.
          Previously, when there are no car or hotels available based on the
          user’s entered criteria, a message simply telling the user to modify
          their search criteria and try again was presented to him/her. Playing
          on the error prevention design heuristic, the redesigned errors were
          made to be more informative and provided users with plausible
          explanations as to why an error occured, and how they can recover
          from it.
