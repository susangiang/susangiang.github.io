          <h4 class="project__subhead">Context</h4>
          <div class="project-body">
            <p>Working with one of the top five banks in Canada, we were tasked with re-imagining the credit card application experience within six  weeks.
              With millions of customers and the desire to be recognized in the market as a "digital-first brand", the current experience did not conform
              to best practices in web and mobile design nor the latest branding guidelines represented in the homepage. In addition, compared to its competitors,
              the application contained the highest number of required fields, leading to high friction in getting a prospective customer off the market.
            </p>

            <h4 class="project__subhead">Role</h4>
            <p>The team consisted of an interaction designer, a design lead, and myself. I worked closely with the interaction designer to champion
              all aspects of the design process, from gathering and synthesizing research, to creating user flows and wireframes.
            </p>

            <h4 class="project__subhead">Process</h4>
            <strong>While all of the artifacts I've worked on are under an NDA, I would be happy to share my design process and discuss the
              project in further detail through an email or call.
            </strong>
            <p>At a high level, some of the things we did included:
              <li>Stakeholder interviews and synthesis</li>
              <li>Competitive analyses of direct, perceptual, and experiential competitors</li>
              <li>Form field audit conducted on competitor experiences</li>
              <li>Facilitated an Envisioning session with stakeholders to align on priorities and goals</li>
              <li>Generated list of experience principles that later guided our design decisions</li>
              <li>Concept sketching</li>
              <li>Wireframes</li>
              <li>Experience brief â€“ an almalgamation of all of the work done on the project</li>
